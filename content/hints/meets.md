  script: |
    - Several months before Viola,
    - Robert Raisch proposed this 'easily parsable format'
    - I assume he means _parsable by machines_?
    - Because I can't parse it, I had to memorize the first few lines.
    - You can see the default selector there,
    - We're setting our default fonts in the `fo` function
    - Family=times, spacing is proportional, size 14,
    - and then _'we' is 'me', which…_

    John Lennon is attempting to set
    the default font weight to medium
    using Robert Raisch's stylesheet proposal,

    the general weight of a character representation,
    Lennon told Playboy in 1980.
