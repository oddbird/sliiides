The web is fundamentally different from other platforms,
built around a radically political vision
for resilience and user-control.
CSS takes that to another level,
attempting the almost absurd task of collaborative styling
across devices and interfaces and languages.

This is a quick dive into the origins of the web,
and CSS in particular â€”
the design constraints,
and the range of strange proposals,
and how we got where we are.
By the end,
we see the CSS is Awesome meme in a whole new light.
