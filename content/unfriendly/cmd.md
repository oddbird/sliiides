    It’s very hard to think or act
    when you can’t tell
    if you’re about to lose your job,
    have your research killed off,
    have your healthcare terminated,
    witness unstoppable crimes,
    or just experience extended
    and **apparently unescapable moral injury**.

    some stacked shallow dishes,
    a trinket tray with off-kilter black-and white
    zig-zags, and a torn-edge red and black rim,
    a red-clay cortado mug with deep texture
    and an icy glazed rim,
    a bent-cone flower pot that sits in the neck
    of a dress form, giving it a head,
    a classical-shaped vase in splattered colors,
    a black clay mug with red arrows,
    two large bowls with galaxy blue glaze,
    a shelf of unfinished mugs and coffee power-overs and tea cups,
    a torn-edge tissue box cover in progress,
    and three large bowls behind two torn-edge platters
    all drying on a table.
