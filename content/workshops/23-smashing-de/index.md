title: Cascading Styles (a CSS deep dive)

A lot has changed in the nearly 30 years since CSS was first proposed,
and new features are shipping at an unprecedented rate --
cascade layers, container queries, the `:has()` selector,
wide-gamut colors, subgrid, and so much more.

Meanwhile,
we're still getting used to custom properties and basic grids!
Taken one at a time, the list can feel overwhelming,
but these features all fit together
to form a highly systemic language based on a radical foundation:
_the cascade of styles_.
